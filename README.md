# Password Generator

The goal here is to modify the starter code to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that will propmt them to select. Some of the criteria was to be presented with a series of prompts such as length, character volume, and character types and display the final result. This will be my thrid challenge and is part of my JavaScript education and training.
